Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters.
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

CODE: 

SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou]' AND CITY REGEXP '[aeiou]$';

EXPLANATION:
Refer to this website to understand the concept of REGEXP and then it should be easy for you to understand. I used REGEXP '^[aeiou]' for getting the 
data feilds which start with all those letter. You can use for a single letter as well, whose syntax would be REGEXP '^A'.

Simlarly, for tuples ending with a,e,i,o,u we have used the syntax REGEXP '[aeiou]$'. For a single letter you can use it like REGEXP 'a$'
Also if you want to get results for tuples ending with string sa, the synatx will be REGEXP 'sa$'
